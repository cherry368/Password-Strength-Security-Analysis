# 🔐 Password Strength & Security Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of password strength, complexity, and security. Includes testing various passwords, analyzing their strength scores, best practices, and studying common password attacks.

## 🧠 Objective

To understand how password complexity impacts overall security by testing various passwords, analyzing their strength, and studying common password attacks.

## 📋 Steps Performed

1. Create multiple passwords with varying complexity levels
2. Include variations using:
   - Uppercase & lowercase letters
   - Numbers
   - Special characters (symbols)
   - Different lengths
3. Test each password using online Password Strength Checkers
4. Record the results — including strength scores and feedback from the tool
5. Analyze and compare which passwords performed best
6. Identify best practices for creating secure passwords
7. Research common password attacks, including:
   - Brute force attacks
   - Dictionary attacks
   - Phishing or credential stuffing
8. Summarize findings on how password complexity improves security and protects against attacks

## 📊 Sample Test Results

| Password Example | Length | Complexity Used | Tool Score | Feedback |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|------------|----------|
| charan123 | 8 | Lowercase + Numbers | Weak | Too short and predictable |
| Charan@123 | 9 | Mixed Case + Symbol + Numbers | Moderate | Could be longer |
| Ch@r@n_MV2025! | 14 | Strong Mix | Strong | Excellent — hard to guess |
| Mv#Ck!789@Secure | 15 | Complex + Long | Very Strong | Very high entropy |

## 💡 Best Practices Learned

- ✅ Use **12+ characters minimum**
- ✅ Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- ✅ Avoid names, birthdays, or common words
- ✅ Use unique passwords for each account
- ✅ Prefer passphrases (e.g., `Sunset!Mountain#Ride2025`)
- ✅ Use a password manager to generate and store passwords securely

## 🧩 Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type | Description | Prevention |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Brute Force** | Systematically tries all combinations | Use long and complex passwords |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Tries words from a dictionary or leaked lists | Avoid common words or patterns |
| **Phishing** | Trick users into revealing passwords | Verify links, avoid unknown sources |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Reuse of stolen credentials | Never reuse passwords across sites |

## 🔍 Conclusion

Password complexity directly improves security. A long, random, and mixed-character password drastically increases the time and effort required for attackers to crack it — making your accounts much safer.
